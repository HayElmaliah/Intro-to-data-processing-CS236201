# Intro to Data Processing and Representation (CS236201) - Homework Solutions

## Course Overview
"Intro to Data Processing and Representation (CS236201)" offered by the Technion CS Department, and taught by Alfred Bruckstein, focuses on basic methods for processing and analyzing information using deterministic and probabilistic tools.
Key topics include:

- Characterization of signals and systems in discrete grids
- Fourier analysis for time-invariant linear systems
- Representation and processing of information in algebraic spaces
- Statistical evaluation
- Fundamentals of random signals
- Concept of convolution
- Random noise
- Parametric models of random processes and their estimation
- Linear prediction and adaptive algorithms
- Proof of optimality and uniqueness of truncated Fourier representations
- Approximations to the clustering problem
- Introduction to functional mappings

## Repository Contents
This repository contains my solutions for the homework assignments of the CS236201 course at the Technion CS Department. I achieved a score of 100 in all assignments.

### Structure
Each homework assignment is divided into two parts:
- **Dry Part (Report)**: PDF files containing theoretical solutions and experimental analysis.
- **Wet Part (Python Notebook)**: Jupyter notebooks running the experiments and practical implementations.
